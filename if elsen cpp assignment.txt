Scenario 1: Access Control
You are developing a simple login system. Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a username
and password. If both the username and password match predefined values, grant access.
Otherwise, deny access.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string a;
    cout<<"enter useename";
    cin>>a;
    int b;
    cout<<"enter password";
    cin>>b;
    if(a=="vinit"&& b==1234){
        cout<<"you are in the system";
    }

    return 0;
}


Scenario 2: Membership Eligibility
Create a program that checks if a user is eligible for a premium membership based on age and
subscription status. If the user is at least 18 years old and has a valid subscription, provide access;
otherwise, deny access.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num;
    cout<<"enter your age";
    cin>>num;
    if(num>=18){
        cout<<"access provide";
    }else{
        cout<<"access denied";
    }
    return 0;
}

Scenario 3: Grade Classification
Design a program that takes a student's numerical grade as input and outputs their corresponding
letter grade. Use if-else statements to categorize the grades as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F'.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num;
    cout<<"enter your number";
    cin>>num;
    if(num>=90){
        cout<<"A";
    }else if(num>=80){
        cout<<"B";
    }else if(num>=70){
        cout<<"c";
    }else if(num>=60){
        cout<<"d";
    }else{
        cout<<"e";
    }
    return 0;
}

Scenario 4: Shipping Charges
Write a C++ program that calculates shipping charges based on the weight of a package. If the weight
is less than or equal to 5 pounds, apply a flat rate; otherwise, charge an additional fee per pound for
weights exceeding 5 pounds.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int weight;
    cout<<"enter your weight";
    cin>>weight;
    if(weight>=5){
        cout<<"apply a flat rate";
    }else{
        cout<<"charge an additional fee per pound";
    }
    return 0;
}

Scenario 5: Discount Calculation
You are working for an e-commerce platform. Implement a program that calculates the total cost of
an order after applying discounts. If the order amount is greater than $50 and the user is a premium
member, provide a 10% discount; otherwise, provide a 5% discount.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int amount,amnt,amnt1;
    cout<<"enter your amount";
    cin>>amount;
    if(amount>=50){
        amnt=50-(50)*10/100;
        cout<<"you are a premium user and your amount is "<<amnt;
    }else{
        amnt1=50-(50)*5/100;
        cout<<"your amount is "<<amnt1;
    }
    return 0;
}

Scenario 6: Ticket Pricing
Develop a program that determines the price of a movie ticket based on the age of the user and the
time of the movie. If the user is a child (age <= 12), provide a discount. If the movie is a matinee
(before 5 PM), apply an additional discount.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int amount,amnt,amnt1,age;
    string movie;
    cout<<"enter your amount ";
    cin>>amount;
    cout<<"enter your age ";
    cin>>age;
    cout<<"enter your movie ";
    cin>>movie;
    
    if(age>12 && movie=="matinee"){
        amnt1=amount-(amount)*15/100;
        cout<<"your amount is "<<amnt1;
    }else if(age>12){
        amnt=amount-(amount)*10/100;
        cout<<"you are a premium user and your amount is "<<amnt;
    }
    return 0;
}
